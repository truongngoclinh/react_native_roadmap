# ROADMAP FOR LEARNING REACT NATIVE

This time, I wanna try to learn React Native, an platform distributed by Facebook.
In simple way: *'React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript"*. But I dont have any experience with JavaScript so at the beginning I need to get familiar with JS syntax, then follow the [React Native guide] (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), finally working/integrating to my current project.

## 1. Understanding JavaScript (2 days)
(http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

The old way, hand-on with [w3schools guide] 

## 2. React Native guide by Facebook
(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

In my opinion, all the things we need to understand React Native is declaratively mention in the [guide on Facebook] (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). Because I have much experience with Android than iOS, so I pick Android first.

2.1 [The Basic] (2 day)
(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html)

Setup enviroment, done the `Hello World!`, handling the basic things, components for a mobile app.

2.2 [React Native Components] (2 days)

How the `Activity, Navigator, the Tab, the ScrollView...` work in React Native?
(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/activityindicator.html)

2.3 [Native Things] **Android** (1 days)
(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android.html)

How about some native components that we cant handle with React Native, how about the performance?

2.4 [Integraion, Debugging, Testing] (3 days)
(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html)

Integrating to my current Android source. Programming always needs debug and test. I thought this part will encounter many weird problems.

2.5 [Extra Topics]

2.6 [iOS Hand-on]
(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios.html)

## 3. Real world discovers (7 days)

Apply React Native to do real work: Cheap Fare on TopPay.
Understanding the UI, the current React Native implementation, ready to maintain.
